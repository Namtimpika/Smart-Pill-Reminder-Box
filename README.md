# Smart-Pill-Reminder-Box
This project is an IoT-based smart pill box developed as an educational prototype.
Through this project, practical knowledge in Arduino programming, sensor interfacing, and mobile application integration was applied.
The system sends scheduled medication reminders to a smartphone via the Blynk application and detects box opening using an infrared sensor.
The project also provided hands-on experience in system integration, basic IoT communication, and low-cost hardware design using commonly available components.
